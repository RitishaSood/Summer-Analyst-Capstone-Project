# Smart Parking Dynamic Pricing System

## üöó Overview

The **Smart Parking Dynamic Pricing System** is a Capstone project leveraging real-time data streams and advanced analytics to optimize parking prices dynamically. The system adjusts parking rates on-the-fly based on live occupancy, demand, queue lengths, traffic, events, and other contextual signals. This maximizes revenue for operators and improves convenience for users, all via a scalable, maintainable, and insightful data pipeline.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture & Workflow

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Parking lot data (CSV) is streamed using Pathway's `replay_csv` to simulate real-time sensor feeds.
   - Data features include: lot ID, capacity, location, occupancy, vehicle type, queue length, traffic, special day flags, and timestamps.

### 2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - Combine date/time into unified timestamps.
   - Sort and clean data.
   - Generate features: occupancy rate, demand volatility, hourly/daily trends, queue length, etc.

### 3. **Streaming Processing (Pathway)**
   - Pathway handles event-by-event record ingestion and stateful streaming aggregations.
   - Tumbling/daily window aggregations are used for dynamic computations.

### 4. **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm**
   - Baseline: Price is a function of max/min occupancy swings and capacity.
   - Extendable: Incorporates traffic, queue, special events, vehicle type for more advanced pricing models (ML/optimization).
   - Output: Recommended price per lot per time window.

### 5. **Visualization & Dashboard**
   - Real-time trends, occupancy, and pricing visualized via Bokeh and Panel.
   - Interactive dashboard for stakeholders to monitor system performance.

### 6. **Scalability & Extensibility**
   - Modular design: Plug in new data sources, pricing models, or dashboard components.
   - (Planned) API endpoints to serve prices to external apps.

## üìä Sample Workflow

1. **Upload** your dataset (e.g., `Capstone dataset.csv`) to the project directory.
2. **Launch** `CapstoneProjectFinalNotebook.ipynb` and execute the cells.
3. **Observe** the live dashboard as prices respond to streaming data.
4. **Extend** the pricing logic in `DynamicPricingFunction` for more sophisticated strategies.
